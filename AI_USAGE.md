- Added error handling for routing edge cases

### Step 5: UI Polish and Final Features
**AI Tasks:**
- Implemented sorting functionality with SortModal
- Enhanced timer cards with better visual design
- Added proper date formatting and display
- Improved overall UI consistency and user experience

**Key AI Contributions:**
- Created interactive sorting modal with multiple sort options
- Enhanced visual design with consistent styling
- Implemented proper date handling and formatting
- Polished user interface for better usability

## Technical Challenges Solved by AI

### 1. Naming Conflicts
**Problem:** Custom Timer model conflicted with dart:async Timer
**AI Solution:** Used import aliasing (`import '../../models/timer.dart' as timer_model`) and renamed variables (`_periodicTimer`)

### 2. State Management Complexity
**Problem:** Complex timer state synchronization across multiple screens
**AI Solution:** Implemented comprehensive BLoC pattern with proper event/state separation and periodic updates

### 3. UI Component Reusability
**Problem:** Need for consistent, reusable UI components
**AI Solution:** Created modular component library (CustomAppBar, CustomButton, CustomCard) with proper props and styling

### 4. Form Validation and Date Handling
**Problem:** Date picker not displaying selected date in input field
**AI Solution:** Added TextEditingController for deadline field and proper date formatting

### 5. Navigation Architecture
**Problem:** Complex navigation with dynamic parameters
**AI Solution:** Implemented GoRouter with proper route definitions and error handling
